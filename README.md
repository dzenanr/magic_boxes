**Categories**: design tool, graphical models, canvas, local storage, json.

##Description
A graphical design tool for domain models of
[dartling] (https://github.com/dzenanr/dartling).
Spirals can be found in the [mb_spirals] (https://github.com/dzenanr/mb_spirals)
project.
The last spiral is a graphical model designer.
The json representation of a model is generated in Model Concepts.
This representation is used in the
[dartling_gen] (https://github.com/dzenanr/dartling_gen) project to
generate code for a model supported by the
[dartling] (https://github.com/dzenanr/dartling) domain model framework.
