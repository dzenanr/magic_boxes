Problems

----------------

Old problem (not present in the last version)

In the ToolBar class of lib/tool_bar.dart

https://github.com/dzenanr/magic_boxes/blob/master/lib/tool_bar.dart

at https://github.com/dzenanr/magic_boxes there are two elements

InputElement itemNameInput;
SelectElement itemCategorySelect;
...
itemNameInput.onChange.listen((Event e) {
itemCategorySelect.onChange.listen((Event e) {

A change in itemCategorySelect triggers a change in itemNameInput!?

What shall I do to prevent a change in one element to trigger a change in other element?
This change complicates a use of the tool.

In the tool, it happens when entering a new attribute for the selected concept:

A new attribute may be added to the selected concept by entering its name in the attribute field.
Use the Enter key to see the name in the concept's attributes.
If you want to use characteristics different from those proposed,
change them first, then enter a name in the attribute field (I want to avoid this.)

Problem:
If you enter an attribute name first without using the Enter key, then change
at least one of its characteristics (e.g., attribute category), the name appears
in the concept's attributes but without a changed characteristic.
Then, you must select it (by entering again its name) in order to apply the change.
